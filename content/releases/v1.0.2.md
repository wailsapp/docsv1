This version brings a number of fetaures and bugfixes.

A *huge* thank you to everyone that was involved in this release!

## Features

  * Multiple connections + Remote connections to bridge supported. Now you can connect to a Wails app running in bridge mode remotely and with multiple connections. Many thanks to [Travis McLane](https://github.com/tmclane) for this awesome addition
  * Vuetify 2 template support! Many thanks to Michael Hipp (https://github.com/MichaelHipp) for the majority of the work and [Travis McLane](https://github.com/tmclane) for the final fixes and getting it over the line!
  * Experimental: Typescript definition file generation - If you build with `-t <definition_file>` it will generate a Typescript definition file for all your bound structs/methods in `<project>/frontend/<definition_file>`. Note: the file will only be generated at *runtime* so make sure you run your app at least once. We aim to move this to a compile time operation in v2. Thanks to [Ricardo Abreu](https://github.com/codenakama) for extensive testing.

## New Distribution Support (Thanks [Byron](https://github.com/bh90210)):

  * Raspian
  * ManjaroARM
  * Deepin

## Bug Fixes

  * Data passed with Emit() now sends correctly. Thanks [Pixdigit](https://github.com/Pixdigit) for raising it.
  * Better application shutdown
